                    "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and
                    demoralized by
                    the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and
                    trouble that
                    are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of
                    will, which is
                    the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy
                    to
                    distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our
                    being able
                    to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain
                    circumstances
                    and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that
                    pleasures have to
                    be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this
                    principle of
                    selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid
                    worse
                    pains."
